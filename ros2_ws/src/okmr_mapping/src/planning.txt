use pcl for projection and segmentation + plane estimation?
https://pcl.readthedocs.io/projects/tutorials/en/master/walkthrough.html#walkthrough

1. create depth -> pointcloud projection, pcl format
    - done using XYZRGBL format

2. test using simulation depth camera
    - if output, success!
    done, just need to add proper intrinsuics for sim

2.5 update proejction node to subscribe to camerainfo message and use the ransofmration amtrix

3. test visualization, use pcl tools to visualize the poitncloud
    - create a tool that requests the most recent pointcloud using a service, and then visualizes just the one?

4. test applying masks
5. test getting average point
6. test clustering
