This is an example of how to create new state machine config folders.
This way you can create a folder with a meaningful label, 
copy the dev folder into it (or whatever other folder)
then make modifications as needed without affecting the dev configs

ex. use cases
can create a folder for vehicle tuning, with specific state machine definitions for that
can create a folder for specific tests (testing a behaviour, testing a specific task)
can create a folder for specific competition attempts
can create a folder for specific pool tests / test plans
