update raph node to use new motor message format]

finish the final piece of the low level control chain - thrust to pwm
resume working on the automated planner once the low level control is verified
run a demo test plan in simulation that we will do at pool test


create a test plan for verifying and fixing the low level control system
    - start low to high, ground up
    - zero out all gains
    - comment out all controllers, test lowest controllers first
    - set one gain at a time

motor thrust - Success, model fixed
axis thrust - Success, thrust allocator works
acceleration
velocity
pose

add a pid watchdog which publishes zeros if the time since last target or actual value subscribtion is too large
