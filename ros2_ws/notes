update raph node to use new motor message format]

finish the final piece of the low level control chain - thrust to pwm

create a test plan for verifying and fixing the low level control system
    - start low to high, ground up
    - zero out all gains
    - comment out all controllers, test lowest controllers first
    - set one gain at a time

motor thrust - Success, model fixed
axis thrust - Success, thrust allocator works
acceleration
    - fixed dead reckoning
    - fixed control layer not subscribing to accel estimate
    - could use better tuning
velocity
    - need to properly tune
pose
    - need to properly tune

transfer tuned sim values to actual files

add a pid watchdog which publishes zeros if the time since last target or actual value subscribtion is too large

resume working on the automated planner once the low level control is verified
run a demo test plan in simulation that we will do at pool test
