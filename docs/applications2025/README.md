    - example: depending on your computer / OS and familiarity, find a way to install ubuntu 24 or 25 or a vm with matching version of ros2

- run basic hello world (talker + listener example)
    - should be in the ros2 installation tutorial

- compile okmr_msgs package and do pub sub with a custom message type 
    - no step by step instructions needed
