# OKMR 2025 Software Application Challenge

## challenge ideas
- install ros2 jazzy or kilted (linux / ubuntu VM, docker, remote server, WSL, dual boot, native boot, litteraly anything)
- run basic hello world (talker + listener example)
- compile okmr_msgs package and do pub sub with a custom message type
- compile a package and run a node? (insane difficulty challenge for the strongest warriors)

instructions or links will be provided for everything
ideally not too easy either (direct copy paste instructions),
leave some initiative / problem solving in there even if just a little

## Possible interview questions (given to applicants ahead of time)
- summarize the functionality of one package? 
- summarize the general structure of the software system (from the technical design report diagram)?
- what is ros2
- how do we use ros2
- what package / software subgroup is most interesting to you and why
